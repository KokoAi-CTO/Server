# Welcome to Cloud Rover Theory!

Hi! **I'm am your Guide for today **Khalid**. Today I well be Guiding on how to Setup the Rover System.  Start by reading the General Overview of how the System works.


## General Overview

The System Framework is Based on Worker Client Server 

First start with the **Server** the Servers Roll is to Mange and Process the data Between Client and Worker.

JSON Data Computer Vision Worker:

-   Object xywh data
    

Processing : Processed by server

Rover Side Server

Data Processing

-   Ultrasonic for each sensor
    

-   add up to 20x /20
    
-   Output: average for 20 cycles
    

-   Image Stream
    

-   Object detection Processed by Computer Vision Worker
    
-   Output: xywh data of Object like Person
    

-   Wifi Data
    

-   Fill in an Array With Room Number to Mac-Address
    
-   Output: Room Number Linked to Mac Address
    

-   Accelerometers data
    

-   Take Integral of Acceleration / time = Velocity
    
-   d = vt
    
-   Output: Distance , Velocity
